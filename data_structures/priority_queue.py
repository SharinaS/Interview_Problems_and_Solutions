PRIORITY QUEUE
- Abstract data type, such as stack or queue
- Every item has a priority value
- The element with high priority is served before an element with lower priority
- Usually implemented with heaps, but it can be implemented with self balancing trees too
- Very similar to queues with some midification: when we'd like to get the next item, the highest priority element is retrieved first... there's no FIFO structure.
