INTROSORT ALGORITHM

"This is a quick sort that switches to a heap sort after a certain recursion depth to get around quick sort’s O(N²) worst case. It’s almost always better than a plain old quick sort, since you get the average case of a quick sort, with guaranteed O(N log N) performance. Probably the only reason to use a heap sort instead of this is in severely memory constrained systems where O(log N) stack space is practically significant."
