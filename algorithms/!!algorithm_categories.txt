ALGORITHMS FOR DEVELOPERS / ENGINEERS
############################################################################
The real goal is to start living and breathing algorithms and data structures: thinking up step-by-step solutions to real-world problems, and picturing complex scenarios in terms of simple data structures. If you can master that, then the coding will come naturally. (Jason Roell - towardsdatascience.com/)

SORTING ALGORITHMS (for ordering (aka sorting) lists of items):
Comparison based algorithms
- bubble sort
- insertion sort
- selection sort
- * merge sort (aka sort merge)
- * quick sort

Non-comparison based algorithms
- radix sort
- bucket sort
- counting sort

Other very common algorithms:
- heap sort (comparison based?)
- intro sort (comparison based?)
- selection sort (comparison based?)


SEARCHING ALGORITHMS:
  - * linear search O(n)
  - * binary search O(logN)
  - Depth First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth First Search(BFS)

GRAPH TRAVERSAL ALGORITHMS:
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Depth First Search(DFS)

MISC:
- Recursion
- Dynamic programming
- Regex (regular expressions for string pattern matching)

In this article we are going to discuss the top clustering algorithms every data scientist must know. It is crucial for a data scientist to have a broad range of knowledge and of course to follow the latest trends in machine learning and data science. Letâ€™s consider the top clustering algorithms one by one:

k-means clustering
dbscan algorithm
hierarchical clustering
expectation-maximization algorithm
