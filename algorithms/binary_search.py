'''Binary Algorithm

Binary means of or relating to 2 things. The algorithm works by splitting the input into two parts until it finds the item that is being searched. One half contains the search item and the other half does not. The splitting continues utnil the spot where the input is split becomes the item that is being searched.

Binary search only works with ordered sequences.
