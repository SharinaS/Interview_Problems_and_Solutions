# Interview Style Problems & Solutions

This is a growing collection of interview style questions with solutions I've created. Some of the solutions include notes and explainations of the code, while others may include several solutions to the one problem. Nearly all the interview solutions are written in **Python 3**. 

The interview problems primarily come from websites such as [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), however there are problems included from interview prep classes from [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/).
